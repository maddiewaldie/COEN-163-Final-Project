    <h1>About Pawsitive Pairings</h1>
    <p>As the number of animals without permanent shelter continues to rise, there is a pressing 
        need for innovative solutions to connect prospective pet owners with their ideal companions. 
        Our project seeks to bridge the gap between abandoned animals and caring individuals by 
        introducing a platform that draws inspiration from the popular dating app, Tinder. 
        Tailored specifically for pet adoption, our app helps users browse through pets in their 
        area and match with potential furry friends. By acknowledging the limitations of existing 
        websites and their impact on adoption rates, we aspire to create a solution that not only 
        enhances accessibility but also enriches the overall experience for users.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, our solution aims to revolutionize the way people perceive and engage with pet adoption, 
        fostering a culture of compassion, responsibility, and happiness for both humans and their 
        newfound furry companions.

  <button class="accordion">Who replies to me on the Chats?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>You guessed correctly...your four-legged friends are not typing the responses!
        Instead, we have team members at Pawsitive Pairings who serve as a voice for the 
        cats and dogs and answer questions about their activity level, likes/dislikes, 
        past experiences, on their behalf.

    <button class="accordion">Where do the animals come from?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Our cats and dogs have diverse backgrounds: some were surrendered by their previous
        families, others were found on the street, and yet others come from other shelters.

    <p>We would love to have you foster one of our fur babies! Send a chat message to the animal
